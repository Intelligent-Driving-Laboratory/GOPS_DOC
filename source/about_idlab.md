# About iDLab

The Intelligent Driving Laboratory (iDLAB) is a part of the School of Vehicle and Mobility (SVM) at Tsinghua University. This lab focuses on advanced control and artificial intelligence algorithms, and their applications on autonomous driving system, connected multiple vehicles, driver assistance system and driver behavior analysis, etc. 

Our research interests are loosely divided into four categories:

**(1) Perception, decision and motion control for autonomous vehicles;** 

**(2) Real-time optimization and optimal control of automotive control systems;**

**(3) Reinforcement learning and approximate dynamic programming;** 

**(4) Optimal filtering and distributed estimation.**

We have achieved a series of important research results and peer-reviewed publications  [available online](http://www.idlab-tsinghua.com/thulab/labweb/research.html). 

Undergraduates, master students, Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers from a variety of disciplines, including automotive/mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science and automation, etc., are welcome to join our lab!  Interested candidates can send your resume and personal statement to {lishuqin1541@tsinghua.edu.cn}.
